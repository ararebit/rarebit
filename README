# Questions

1. How can I determine whether to use id or class as elegantly as in the microblog example?

2. Which tags or attribute values are needlessly redundant? All FOR attribute values?

#Notes

1. Separate out ranges of ingredients into two SPAN tags.

2. Note allowable values. Assuming existence of some controlled vocabularies, e.g. for unit and food items.
